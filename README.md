# bloglist

### About

A simple MERN stack app displaying a list of blogs.

### Details

This is the second MERN stack app I've built. The previous app I built, the phonebook app, was created during the [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/) program, which had a lot of hand-holding as I learned Mongo, Express, React, and Node.

This app was built with zero hand-holding, as I wanted to build a new app from scratch to ensure that I had a full comprehension of all of the steps involved with creating a new MERN app and deploying it to Render. 

### Features

* The [app is hosted on Render](https://bloglist-fvx5.onrender.com/).

* The actual functionality of the app is intentionally very limited, as the homepage only allows for adding new blogs to the list.

* The CSS is minimal as my focus wasn't on design or layout, but instead learning the MERN stack.

### Todos

* Add the ability to delete blogs from the list.

* Add an option for `likes` to the `Add a New Blog` section

* Refactor the application into separate modules.
